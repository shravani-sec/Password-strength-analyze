# Password Strength Analysis

## **Objective**
To create multiple passwords of varying complexity, test them using a password strength checker, and analyze their effectiveness based on the results.

---

## **Methodology**
- Created a set of passwords with different complexity levels (weak to strong).
- Tested each password using an online password strength checker.
- Recorded the score, strength level, and feedback from the tool.
- Analyzed the results to identify password creation best practices.
- Researched common password attack methods.

## **Results**

| Password            | Score (%) | Strength Level | Feedback |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| maithitirakshe     |    15%    | Weak           | Too short and predictable lacks numbers & symbols |
| $hr@v@n!8435         |   100%      | Very strong         |Good use of symbol|
| shravani35           |   37%      | Weak         |   Add more characters and symbols for better strength |
| Indi@n@irforce003  | 100%      | Very Strong    | Excellent length, complexity, and randomness |
| admin123            |   39%     | Weak           | Short and lacks complexity |

---

## **Findings**
- Passwords shorter than 8 characters are consistently rated weak.
- Adding numbers and special characters improves strength.
- Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters boosts security.
- Length is critical — passwords over 12 characters score significantly higher.
- Avoid dictionary words to reduce vulnerability to attacks.

---

## **Common Password Attacks**
- **Brute Force**: Trying all possible combinations until the password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using a list of common words and variations.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen credentials from previous breaches.

---

## **Best Practices**
1. Use at least **12–16 characters**.
2. Include **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special symbols**.
3. Avoid personal info like names, birthdates, or phone numbers.
4. Use unique passwords for each account.
5. Consider using a password manager to store strong, random passwords.

---

## **Conclusion**
Password complexity plays a crucial role in resisting hacking attempts.  
The analysis shows that a mix of length, character diversity, and randomness results in the highest password strength scores. Adopting strong password practices significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
